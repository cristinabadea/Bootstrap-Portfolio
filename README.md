# Challenge Week 2

## Description

I have created a website portfolio from scratch using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in order to expose and organise my present and future projects.
It contains 4 parts: the header with the navbar and the hero banner, the about me and contact details section, the work section which contains the projects I've already implemented and some placeholders for the next and the footer.
